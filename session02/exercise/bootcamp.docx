Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools
MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022

In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.

First you will learn about a tool for version control called Git, which 
can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called Github.
Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor Visual 
Studio Code, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
a web server. 

In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
componentes for modern web development:

1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. Javascript

Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.
