<h2>Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
<h1>MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.</p>

<p>First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
    can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
    Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> 
, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
    a web server. </p>

<p>In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
    componentes for modern web development:</p>

<ol>
    <li>HTML</li>  
    <li>CSS</li> 
    <li>Javascript</li> 
</ol>


<p>Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
    a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.</p>
