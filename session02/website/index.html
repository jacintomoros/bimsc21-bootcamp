    <h2>Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
    <h1>MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022</h1>

    <p class="special-items">In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.</p>

    <p id="special">First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
        can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
        Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> 
    , which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
        a web server. </p>

    <p>In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
        componentes for modern web development:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>  
        <li>CSS</li> 
        <li>Javascript</li> 
    </ol>


    <p class="special-items">Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
        a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.</p>
